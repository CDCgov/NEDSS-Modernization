### Added
Instructions for using TypeScript ( #61  - thanks to @KeithGillette for discovering that it never actually worked, made possible by 1.2.0 with the input from @bensampaio )

## [1.2.0] - 2018-07-13

## [1.0.0] - 2018-04-21

### Added
Regular expressions working in step definitions ( #42 - thanks to @stevepkuo for reporting !)
### Changed
Scenarios run as single steps now. ( #44 / #43  - thanks so much to @BenoitAverty not only for the PR but for the courage to question the status quo/think outside of the box here :) )
This has a downside of less readable/uglier test reports, but allows realistically testing of real-world web applications. We will revisit once Cypress makes necessary adjustments - cypress-io/cypress#686
